# DevOps Training Assignments Repository

Welcome to my DevOps training assignments repository! This repository is where I will be uploading my assignments and projects for the DevOps training course.

## Assignments Structure

Each assignment will have its own folder within this repository. Inside each folder, you'll find the necessary files, scripts, documentation, and any other resources related to that assignment.

## How to Navigate

To navigate through the repository and find specific assignments:

1. **Browse the Repository**: You can explore the repository by clicking through the folders listed above.
2. **Search**: Use the search bar at the top of the repository page to find assignments by keywords or titles.
3. **Assignment Index**: I will maintain an index file (INDEX.md or README.md) at the root of the repository, listing all assignments along with brief descriptions and links to their respective folders.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily for my assignments, I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from fellow DevOps enthusiasts and mentors. If you have any improvements, corrections, or ideas to share, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Contact

If you have any questions, concerns, or just want to connect, you can reach me at [gideonsango@gmail.com](mailto:gideonsango@gmail.com).
